###
This 2D physics engine is intended to be a C++ library which can be used as a generic way to 
handle physics in games/models etc. 

Planned features: -
->gravity implementation
->collision detection
->force,acc,vel and pos controller

Maybe features: -
->string physics
->elastic physics
->soft body physics
->water physics

Even more maybe : all this in 3D.
